# Chapter 5: The Future - Giving It a Voice

Phase A (Book Generation) is complete. The next step is **Phase B: RAG Chatbot**.

## How It Will Work
1.  **Vector Database (Qdrant):** We will turn this book's content into numbers (Embeddings).
2.  **The Chatbot:** A floating widget will appear on this site.
3.  **The Conversation:** A user can ask, "How did you set up the backend?" and the AI will read Chapter 3 and answer.

We have already laid the foundation with `llm_rag.py` and `qdrant.py` services. The brain is ready to be awakened.
