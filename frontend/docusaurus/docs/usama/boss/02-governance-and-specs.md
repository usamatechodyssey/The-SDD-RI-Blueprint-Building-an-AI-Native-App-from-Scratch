# Chapter 2: Setting the Rules (Governance)

Before writing a single line of Python, we wrote the **Laws**.

## The Constitution
We created a `constitution.md` file that governs our project. It mandated:
1.  **Traceability:** Every task must have an ID (e.g., T001).
2.  **Secrets:** No API keys in Git.
3.  **RI First:** Every logic must be a "Skill".

## Writing the Specifications
We didn't guess the features. We wrote them down in `specs/001-book-creation/`.
-   **Plan.md:** Defines the Architecture.
-   **Tasks.md:** Defines the exact Checklist.
-   **Contracts:** Defines the API Design (OpenAPI).

This ensured that when we started coding, we knew exactly what to build.
