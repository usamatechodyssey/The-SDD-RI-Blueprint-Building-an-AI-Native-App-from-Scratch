# We have Liftoff! 🚀

Today marks a major milestone in our Hackathon journey. We have successfully completed **Phase A: The Book Generation Engine**.

## What we achieved:
1.  **Backend Core:** A FastAPI engine that understands Markdown.
2.  **Frontend:** A dynamic Docusaurus site that builds itself.
3.  **Governance:** Strictly following SDD-RI principles with Traceability.

## What's Next? (Phase B)

Now that the static book is ready, we are moving to **Phase B: RAG Chatbot**.
We will be integrating **Qdrant** and **Gemini** to let users "Talk to the Book".

Stay tuned!
