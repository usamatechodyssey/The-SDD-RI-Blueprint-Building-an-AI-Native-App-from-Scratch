# Chapter 1: The Vision & The Problem

## Why This Project Exists
Most developers just jump into coding. They write messy code, forget why they made decisions, and create "Spaghetti Code". We wanted to change that.

Our goal was to win the Hackathon by demonstrating **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** with **Reusable Intelligence (RI)**.

## What We Built
We built an **AI-Native Book Generator**.
- It takes raw text/markdown.
- It understands the content (using AI).
- It builds a beautiful website automatically.
- It answers questions about the content via a Chatbot.

## The Roadmap
This book documents our exact journey from an empty folder to a production-ready AI application.
